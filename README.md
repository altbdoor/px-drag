About
-----
pxDrag is a small JavaScript for object panning or "drag and drop" within a boundary. It was made after a number of frustrated attempts in using image panning plugins.


Browser Support
---------------
- Internet Explorer 8+
- Firefox 22.0+
- Chrome 22.0+
- Safari 5.1+
- Opera 16.0+

Please note that the browser support is rather demanding, as it uses `getComputedStyle` to determine the initial margin values of the target element. To support older browsers, you could define the margin values immediately with the style attribute, although it is not recommended.
